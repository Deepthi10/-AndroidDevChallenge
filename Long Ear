Tell us what your idea is.

Long Ears-This app is a best friend to people who can not afford hearning aids. This app manisfests the sorrounding sound into
captions. This hearing app hears for the person & displays every single sound into a caption. For instance, the user is 
at her home, there is a fire rescue truck nearing her house, the app listens & translates the voice to text & vibrates
to let the user know by displaying caption "Fire rescue truck in your neighbourhood". The idea is to use ML voice to text
learning techniques. The voice coverage can be increased with installing bluetooths at house & other ML techniques & google APIs.


Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 

Researching more on how to use existing ML techniques & google API on how to make this app hear at longer distances.
Time line 4-5 months.
Coding is still in progress
